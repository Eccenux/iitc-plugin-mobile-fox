# IITC plugin: Mobile Fox UX

Plugin focused in making IITC better for mobile phones. This is for users of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox" target="_blank">Firefox mobile</a> which is a browser I highly recommend anyway for Android.

Installation
------------

Note! This is an alfa version (very experimental). Probably not ready for general public use.

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-mobile-fox/raw/master/mobile-fox.user.js)**.


### Other browsers ###

Most of this tweaks probably won't make sense for the old IITC Mobile app. But if you know another mobile browser that supports Tampermonkey or similar then all of those tweaks should work fine too. So in other words this plugin aims to fix some generic problems with Ingress Intel in mobile browsers and is not really specific to Firefox.


### Other plugins ###

Note I also have a different plugin which is focused in making FF mobile desktop view a bit more readable [enlarge-tools](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-enlarge-tools).
